# Specify the Functional Unit according to ISO 14044 Life Cycle Analysis principles

## Description:
This document outlines the steps necessary to specify the Functional Unit according to ISO 14044 Life Cycle Analysis principles. It covers the definition of the Functional Unit, the selection of the functional unit, and the calculation of the Functional Unit in accordance with the ISO 14044 standards. The document also provides guidance on the use of ISO 14044 to evaluate the environmental impact of a product or system.

## Exemple:
1. Definition of the Functional Unit: The Functional Unit is the unit of measure used to represent the performance of a product or service. It should be based on the intended use of the product or service, and should be as specific and quantifiable as possible.

2. Selection of the Functional Unit: The Functional Unit should be selected based on the purpose of the Life Cycle Analysis. It should be specific to the system or product being analyzed, and should be as precise as possible.

3. Calculation of the Functional Unit: The Functional Unit is calculated using the ISO 14044 Life Cycle Analysis standard. This standard provides guidance on how to calculate the Functional Unit for a given system or product. 

4. Use of ISO 14044 to Evaluate Environmental Impact: The ISO 14044 Life Cycle Analysis can be used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product or system. This standard provides guidance on how to calculate the Functional Unit, as well as how to use the results of the analysis to evaluate the environmental impact of a product or system.
