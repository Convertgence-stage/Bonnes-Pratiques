# Select PCB finishing treatment taking into account environmental considerations

## Description:
This project aims to select a PCB finishing treatment that is compliant with environmental regulations. The evaluation criteria for this project should include the effects of the treatment on the environment, the cost of the treatment, and the durability of the finish. The project should also identify any potential safety risks associated with the PCB finishing treatment. The output of this project should be a list of suitable PCB finishing treatments that meet the evaluation criteria.

## Exemple:
This project will evaluate the different finishing treatments available for printed circuit boards (PCBs) in order to select the most suitable one, taking into account environmental considerations. The evaluation criteria will include the effects of the finish on the environment, the cost of the treatment, the durability of the finish, and any potential safety risks associated with the treatment. 

Information on the various PCB finishing treatments available will be collected from online sources and industry experts. The environmental impact of each treatment will be evaluated using established standards and protocols. The cost of the treatment and the durability of the finish will also be taken into consideration. The safety risks associated with each treatment will be assessed based on industry standards and safety protocols. 

Using the collected data and information, a list of suitable PCB finishing treatments that meet the evaluation criteria will be generated. The list will include a brief description of each treatment, as well as the associated cost and environmental impact. 

The project will also provide recommendations on the most suitable PCB finishing treatment, taking into account all the evaluation criteria. These recommendations will be presented in a final report.
